## üî± Creating a fork branch in GitHub  

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to Top](#-collaborator-guide-how-to-work-on-this-repository)
- To avoid having conflicts with the main branch (where owner is working), each collaborator is recommended to create their own fok of the github repo.
### 1. Go to the main repo page.
-  click on the **Fork** on the top-right corner.
    ![Alt text](Resources/gitfork.png)<br>

This creates a copy of the repository under your own github account.

## üîß First-Time Git Setup  

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to Top](#-collaborator-guide-how-to-work-on-this-repository)

### 1. Open Git Bash and configure Git [only once] (do it line-by-line)  
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
```

### 2. Navigate to the repo folder and initialize Git (do it line-by-line)

```bash
cd C:/Users/<YourName>/Batch-RinexConverter
git init
```

### 3. Add remote connections (do it line-by-line)
Replace with your GitHub username and repo name.
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
git remote add upstream https://github.com/<owner-username>/Batch-RinexConverter.git
```
### 4. Verify that the remotes are set
```bash
git remote -v
```
Expected output should be something like this:
```bash
origin   https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git (fetch)
origin   https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git (push)
upstream https://github.com/Cyaltie/Batch-RinexConverter.git (fetch)
